We have to run network in host mode, since kafka is available in localhost:9092, but
since we are dockerizing this app, it was using the docker ip and not the docker host ip.
To use the docker host ip it is necessary to add --network=host.
THe simulator must have the bootstrap address set to spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=kafka:29092 if
it is running in the same docker network (basically in the same docker compose), otherwise it is necessary
to run also as --network=host ( i guess, not tested).
